## Critical Weed-Free Periods 

#### History 

.pull-left[
- Concept introduced by [Nieto et al. (1968)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/05331856809432576?journalCode=ttpmc20)

> ... there are periods when weeds must be removed and other periods when the may be allowed to grow because they do not cause the slightest harm to the crop.

<br>

- [Zimdahl 1980](https://www.cabi.org/isc/abstract/19802329938) reviewed conducted studies but no practical use of the concept was reported

## Critical Weed-Free Periods

#### History 

.pull-left[
- The use of postemergence herbicides with little residual activity in the 1990s reniewed the interest on the critical time for weed control in crops 


- Herbicide resistant crops were introduced and many studies were conducted to determine the most appropriate timing and periodicity for weed control

## Critical Weed-Free Periods in Crops

#### Historical reasons for studying

1. The potential to reduce the amount of herbicide used by achieving optimal application timing

--

1. The potential to reduce environmental and ecological degradation associated with the prophylactic use of herbicides

--

1. Provide a test to determine whether the methods of weed control are based on biological necessity

--

1. Need for the economic optimization of weed control tactics in herbicide tolerant crops through timely application of POST herbicides

## Assumptions of Methodology

- The dynamics of weed species composition and the relative
time of emergence

--

- The way in which the **critical time for weed control** is determined from two separately measured components.



---

## Experimental Approach

- The **critical time for weed control** should be based primarily on the crop growth stage

--

- Typical Variables

  - Crop yield
  - Weed species density and composition
  - Date of weed and crop emergence in every experimental unit
  - Crop stage/height and weed height
  - Weed biomass
  - Environmental data

--
  
- Number of data points

  - Minimum 4 data points
  - Six to seven data points are ideal
  - Select two to three points clustered around the **early part** of the season, and two to three points clustered around the time of **crop canopy closure**

---

## Statistical Analysis

#### Nonlinear regression analysis

  - Time of weed removal (x-axis) should be related to actual or relative crop yield (y-axis)
  - Growing degree days (GDD) accumulated from crop emergence or planting as the unit for time to quantify the duration of weed presence and length of the weed-free period (x-axis).

$$
GDD = \sum_{}^{}{(\frac{(Tmax + Tmin)}{2}) - Tbase}
$$

## Determination of Critical Weed-Free Periods in Crops

- The combination of **weedy** and **weed-free** curve generates the critical time for weed control

## Acceptable Yield Loss

.pull-left[
- The begining of critical time for weed control will depend on the level of acceptable yield loss

  - Most of studies report anywhere from 2 to 10% the maximum acceptable yield loss
  
  - Can be adjust depending on the cost of control and the anticipated financial gain

## Critical Weed-Free Periods in Canola

.pull-left[

#### Study in Manitoba, CAN

- 10% acceptable yield loss

- Canola must be kept weed-free in most cases until the four-leaf stage of the crop (17–38 days after crop emergence)

- In one early-seeded experiment, until the six-leaf stage of the crop (days after crop emergence)

- Few weeds emerged after four to six-leaf stage

## Take Home Message

- The **Critical Weed-Free Periods** is best described with a sigmoid regression curve
 
<br>

--

- The **Critical Weed-Free Periods** vary with location, time and management practices

<br>

--

- The **Critical Weed-Free Periods** has the potential to influence decision making on the timing of postemergence weed management

<br>

--

- The **Critical Weed-Free Periods** is an import part of the integrated weed management

<br>

--

- Zero weed tolerance (herbicide resistant weeds) has brought the need of clean fields, reducing use of the **Critical Weed-Free Periods** concept
